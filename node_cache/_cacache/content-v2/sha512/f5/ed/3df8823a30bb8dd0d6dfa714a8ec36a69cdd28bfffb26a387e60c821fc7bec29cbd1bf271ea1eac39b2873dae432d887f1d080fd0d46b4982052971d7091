vue-electron\n> The vue plugin that wraps [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) APIs to the Vue object.\n\n[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n\n### Need a full boilerplate for creating electron apps built with vue? Make sure to check out electron-vue.\n[https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue)\n\n## Installing\nInstall using NPM\n```\nnpm install vue-electron --save\n```\n\nInclude using webpack or browserify\n\n**main.js**\n```js\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport VueElectron from 'vue-electron'\n\nVue.use(VueElectron)\n```\n\n## Using the plugin\nThis plugin will attach electron APIs to the Vue object itself, so accessing all APIs is dead simple. All official documentation from electron can be used and accessed from `this.$electron`.\n\nSo instead of...\n```js\nconst electron = require('electron')\n\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    getName () {\n      return electron.remote.app.getName()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can...\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    getName () {\n      return this.$electron.remote.app.getName()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you might be thinking, \"Is it really that annoying to simply require electron to access it?\" Probably not, but it can get cumbersome to have to include it in every component file that needs it. In the end, attaching electron directly to Vue just makes sense.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"simulatedgreg","email":"simulatedgreg@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-02-22T03:34:13.619Z","created":"2016-06-02T15:55:48.156Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-02T15:55:48.156Z","1.0.1":"2016-06-09T04:16:43.001Z","1.0.2":"2016-06-09T04:22:29.635Z","1.0.4":"2016-07-12T18:38:07.692Z","1.0.5":"2016-12-12T10:47:25.177Z","1.0.6":"2016-12-12T10:53:26.553Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/vue-electron#readme","keywords":["vue","electron","api","wrapper"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/vue-electron.git"},"author":{"name":"Greg Holguin","email":"simulatedgreg@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/vue-electron/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"simulatedgreg":true,"faraoman":true,"anker":true},"_attachments":{}}
